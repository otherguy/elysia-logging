## üåà Features

* **Structured Logging** - Log in JSON format for easy parsing and filtering
* **Customizable** - Customize the log level, formatter and logger
* **Production First** - Designed for production environments first

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# For bun
bun add @otherguy/elysia-logging

# For npm
npm install @otherguy/elysia-logging

# For yarn
yarn add @otherguy/elysia-logging
```

## üìö Usage

By default, the plugin will log to the console using the `console` module. The default formatter is `json` and the default log level is `info`.

```ts
import { Elysia } from "elysia";
import { ElysiaLogging } from "../src/elysiaLogging";

// Create Elysia app
const app = new Elysia()
  .use(ElysiaLogging())
  .get("/", () => {
    return new Response("Welcome to Bun!");
  })
  .listen(3000);

console.log(`Running at http://${app.server?.hostname}:${app.server?.port}`);
```

Using the default settings, the plugin will log the following for each request. Since the `console` module is pretty printing the JSON, the output in the console will be formatted slightly differently.

```json
{
  "message": "GET / completed with status 200 in 363.3¬µs",
  "request": {
    "ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "method": "GET",
    "url": {
      "path": "/",
      "params": {}
    }
  },
  "response": {
    "status_code": 200,
    "time": 363250
  }
}
```

### Custom Logger

Since the `console` is very limited, you may want to use a custom logger. The recommended logger is [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) but you can use any logger that can implement the `Logger` interface.

See the [examples](examples) directory for implementation examples.

* [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) (see [example](examples/pino.ts))
* [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) (see [example](examples/winston.ts))
* [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) (see [example](examples/bunyan.ts))

## ü™ú Examples

A few examples are provided in the [`examples`](examples) directory.

* [Basic](examples/basic.ts) - A basic example of using the plugin with the default settings
* [JSON](examples/json.ts) - A basic example of logging in JSON
* [Custom Function](examples/custom-function.ts) - An example of using a function as custom logging formatter
* [On Error](examples/on-error.ts) - An example of logging errors in addition to access logging
* [Pino](examples/pino.ts) - An example of using the [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) logger
* [Pino Pretty](examples/pino.ts) - An example of using the [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) logger with [pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) _(not recommended for production)_
* [Winston](examples/winston.ts) - An example of using the [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logger

## üìú To Do

* [ ] Add logger format classes
* [ ] Add whitelist for request parameters
* [ ] Add more logger examples (~~Bunyan~~, npmlog)
